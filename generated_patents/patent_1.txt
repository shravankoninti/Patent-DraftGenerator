DESCRIPTION

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION 
     This application claims benefit of priority under 35 USC 119 based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2018-150311 filed on Aug. 9, 2018, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. RELATED ART 
     A resistive element (also called a resistor or a resistance element) is one of the basic circuit elements in an electronic device. For example, when a semiconductor device (e.g., a memory device) includes a memory cell, the memory cell includes a resistive element. The resistive element may be formed in a semiconductor substrate. The resistive element has a resistance value and is configured to supply electric power to other components. In a manufacturing process of the semiconductor device, a defect of the resistive element is detected. In order to detect the defect of the resistive element, a dummy element (also called a dummy resistor or a dummy resistance element) may be used. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-242326 discloses a semiconductor device including a dummy element. The dummy element includes a semiconductor substrate, an insulating film formed on the semiconductor substrate, and a resistive layer formed on the insulating film. The method includes the following steps: (a) forming an insulating film on a semiconductor substrate; (b) forming a resistive layer on the insulating film; (c) forming a first electrode on the resistive layer; (d) forming a second electrode on the insulating film; and (e) forming an interlayer insulating film between the first and second electrodes. The resistive layer in the step (b) is formed by a sputtering method. However, there is a need to improve the accuracy of detecting the defect of the resistive element. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a dummy element and a method of examining a defect of a resistive element that have improved accuracy of detecting the defect. According to a first aspect of the present invention, a dummy element for simulating a defective state of a resistive element of a target to be examined is provided. The dummy element includes: a semiconductor substrate; a lower insulating film deposited on the semiconductor substrate; a first resistive layer deposited on the lower insulating film; an interlayer insulating film covering the first resistive layer; a first pad-forming electrode deposited on the interlayer insulating film so as to be connected to the first resistive layer; a second pad-forming electrode deposited on the interlayer insulating film so as to be connected to the first resistive layer; and a third resistive layer deposited on the interlayer insulating film so as to be connected to the first resistive layer. According to a second aspect of the present invention, a method of examining a defect of a resistive element is provided. The method includes the following steps: preparing a dummy element including a first resistive layer; connecting the first resistive layer to a first pad-forming electrode and a second pad-forming electrode; and connecting the first resistive layer to a third resistive layer. The defective state of the resistive element is caused by a defect in the resistive element. The problem in the manufacturing process is caused by, for example, a process condition in the manufacturing process.
