     BACKGROUND 
     1. Field of the Invention 
     The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition for promoting lipid biosynthesis, a cosmetic composition for inducing differentiation of adipose precursor cells or stem cells into adipocytes, and a cosmetic composition for moisturizing the skin, all of which include an amide-based compound. 
     2. Description of the Related Art 
     As aging progresses, the amount of collagen, which is the main component of the skin, decreases and the skin becomes thinner. In particular, the thickness of the epidermis, which is the outermost layer of the skin, decreases, and wrinkles appear due to the decrease of the dermis. As a result, the skin loses its elasticity and becomes rough. 
     Therefore, in order to prevent the skin from becoming rough, it is necessary to supplement the amount of collagen in the skin. For this, various cosmetic compositions have been developed. However, the effect of the existing cosmetic compositions for moisturizing the skin is not sufficient, and there is a need for cosmetic compositions for promoting lipid biosynthesis, inducing differentiation of adipose precursor cells or stem cells into adipocytes, and moisturizing the skin, all of which include an amide-based compound. 
     SUMMARY 
     In an aspect, the present invention provides a cosmetic composition for promoting lipid biosynthesis, a cosmetic composition for inducing differentiation of adipose precursor cells or stem cells into adipocytes, and a cosmetic composition for moisturizing the skin, all of which include an amide-based compound. 
     In another aspect, the present invention provides a cosmetic composition for promoting lipid biosynthesis, a cosmetic composition for inducing differentiation of adipose precursor cells or stem cells into adipocytes, and a cosmetic composition for moisturizing the skin, all of which include an amide-based compound. 
     In another aspect, the present invention provides a cosmetic composition for promoting lipid biosynthesis, a cosmetic composition for inducing differentiation of adipose precursor cells or stem cells into adipocytes, and a cosmetic composition for moisturizing the skin, all of which include an amide-based compound.
