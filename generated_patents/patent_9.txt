SUMMARY
This application claims the benefit of U.S Provisional Application No 60/785,646 filed on Mar. 24, 2006, titled “Total Power Margin Test”, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This disclosure is directed toward determining the total power margin available in a network. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the total power margin available in a network. More specifically, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the total power margin available in a network using a test signal containing a test data packet. Network elements (e.g., base stations, repeaters, amplifiers, etc.) are typically designed with a safety margin to account for the power margin available in a network. The power margin available in a network is the difference between the maximum power that a network element can transmit and the minimum power necessary to maintain a desired quality of service (QoS). The power margin available in a network is typically determined by measuring the received signal strength of a signal transmitted by a network element at different power levels. For example, a network element can be measured at three different power levels. The first power level is the minimum power level necessary to maintain a desired QoS. The second power level is the maximum power level that the network element can transmit. The difference between the first and second power levels is the power margin available in the network. The power margin available in a network is typically determined by measuring the received signal strength of a signal transmitted by a network element at different power levels. For example, a network element can be measured at three different power levels. The first power level is the minimum power level necessary to maintain a desired QoS. The second power level is the maximum power level that the network element can transmit. The difference between the first and second power levels is the power margin available in the network. It is known that measuring the received signal strength of a network element at different power levels can be done using a test signal. The test signal is typically generated by a test signal generator and transmitted to the network element being tested. The test signal is received by a receiver and its received signal strength is measured. The network element being tested is typically set to transmit at different power levels and the received signal strength of the test signal is measured at each power level. For example, a test signal can be transmitted to a network element at power level P 1  and the received signal strength of the

ABSTRACT

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/785,646 filed on Mar. 24, 2006, titled “Total Power Margin Test”, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. 
     FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     This disclosure is directed toward determining the total power margin available for an HFC network. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The total power margin of an HFC network is typically determined by measuring the error rate of a test signal as the power level of the test signal is increased. The error rate of the test signal is measured at each power level to determine whether the error rate exceeds a predetermined threshold. Once the error rate of the test signal exceeds the predetermined threshold, the test is terminated and the total power margin is determined to be the current power level of the test signal. 
     While the method described above may provide a reasonably accurate measurement of the total power margin available for an HFC network, it is not always the most accurate method of determining the total power margin available for an HFC network. This is because the error rate of the test signal is measured while the test signal is being transmitted through the HFC network. The error rate of the

DESCRIPTION

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/785,646 filed on Mar. 24, 2006, titled “Total Power Margin Test”, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     This disclosure is directed toward determining the total power margin available for a High Frequency Communications (“HFC”) network. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The available power margin in a network is determined by increasing the transmission power levels of selected network elements while transmitting a test signal. The quality of the test signal is measured during the successive increases in power level of the selected network elements by measuring the error rate of the test signal. Once the error rate of the test signal reaches a predetermined threshold, the power levels of the signals on the network are considered to have reached the maximum power level for the network. The network may be a HFC network. A HFC network includes a headend, which contains a plurality of fiber optic cables and fiber optic transmitters and receivers, a fiber optic cable network that transmits the signals from the headend to a plurality of optical network units (“ONUs”), a fiber optic cable network that transmits the signals from the ONUs to a plurality of optical network terminals (“ONTs”), and a fiber optic cable network that transmits the signals from the ONTs to a plurality of customer premises equipment (“CPEs”). The HFC network may also include a plurality of amplifiers, a plurality of optical splitters, and a plurality of ONUs. The fiber optic cable network may be configured such that the optical signals are transmitted from the headend to the ONUs, and from the ONUs to the ONTs. The signals may be transmitted to the ONUs over a first wavelength λ 1, and the signals may be transmitted from the ONUs to the ONTs over a second wavelength λ 2. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     A method and apparatus for determining the total power margin available for an HFC network is disclosed. In one embodiment, the method and apparatus
