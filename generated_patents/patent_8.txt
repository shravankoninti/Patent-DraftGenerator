ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Field of the Invention 
     The field of the invention relates to devices and methods designed to promote speech and language development among young children, in particular, learning upper and lower case letters, shapes, colors, numbers and phonemes to improve articulation. Phonemes, which form one of the basic building blocks of speech, are distinguishing speech sounds that differentiate one word from another, e.g. the sounds “d” and “t” in the words “bid” and “bit” and are the smallest phonetic units that can carry meaning (Encarta® World English Dictionary ©2009 Microsoft Corp.) 
     Description of the Related Art 
     From a U.S. Department of Education report (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, “Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K),” U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C., 2002) and other reports, it is clear that children who are not proficient in speaking and reading by the time they enter school are at risk for continuing academic problems. This is especially true for children who are from low-income families. The report also shows

CLAIMS

     Description of the Related Art 
     From a U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0050373, which is hereby incorporated by reference, there is known a game for teaching children upper and lower case letters, shapes, colors, numbers and phonemes to improve articulation. The game comprises a game board, magnetic pieces representing upper and lower case letters, shapes, colors, numbers and phonemes, cards and a number box. The game is played by a child, who, after reading the instructions on a card, moves a magnetic piece on the game board to a position indicated on the card and pronounces the phoneme represented by the magnetic piece. The game may be played in a variety of ways. For example, the child may be asked to move the magnetic piece to a position indicated on the card, read the phoneme represented by the magnetic piece and then say the word that starts with the phoneme. These and other objects of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS 
     The invention will be described with reference to the following drawings, wherein like numbers refer to like parts, elements and methods in the several views and in which: 
     FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the cards used in the device for promoting speech and language development among young children according to the present invention; 
     FIG. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
     With reference to FIG. The game board  12, as shown in FIG. 1, is a board having a plurality of spaces or squares  22. Each space  22 is provided with a magnetic base  24 on which a magnetic piece  14 is placed. The magnetic piece  14, as shown in FIG. 2, is a piece having a front side  32 and a back side  34. The front side  32 is also provided with a letter or shape  38 and a number  40. The letter or shape  38 is a letter or shape of a color that corresponds to the color of the letter or shape on the magnetic base  24. The number  40 is a number that corresponds to the number of the space  22 on the game board  12. The magnetic piece  14 is also provided with a phoneme  44. The phoneme  44 is a phoneme that corresponds to the phoneme represented by the magnetic base  24. The cards  16, as shown in FIG. 3, are cards having a front side  46 and a back side  48. The front side  46 is provided with a picture  50 or a word  52. The picture  50 or the word  52 is a picture or a word that begins with the phoneme represented by the magnetic piece  14. The back side  48 is provided with instructions  54. The number box  18, as shown in FIG. 4, is a box having a front side  56 and a back side  58. The front side  56 is provided with a magnetic material  60 that allows the number box  18 to be magnetically attached to the game board  12. The back side  58 is provided with a number  62. The plastic shapes  20, as shown in FIG. 5, are plastic shapes having a front side  64 and a back side  66. The front side  64 is provided with a shape  68. The shape  68 is a shape that corresponds to the shape on the magnetic base  24. The plastic shape  20 may be used by itself to promote speech and language development among young children. Although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments, it is understood that various modifications and adaptations can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
