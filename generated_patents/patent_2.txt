DESCRIPTION

TECHNICAL FIELD 
     The present application is filed claiming the priority of the Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-193237, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by references. The present invention relates to fluorescent molecular probes for implementing fluorescent detection (visualization) of tumors or, in addition to the fluorescent detection, photodynamic treatment, for instance, by using fluorescence endoscope or fluorescent laparoscope. The conventional fluorescent molecular probe is a fluorescent molecule such as indocyanine green (ICG), fluorescein, or rhodamine. The fluorescent molecule is administered into a human body to be used as a fluorescent probe for implementing fluorescent detection or photodynamic treatment of tumors. The indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent molecule having an excitation peak at 800 nm, and a peak of fluorescence emission at 830 nm. The ICG has been used as a fluorescent probe for implementing fluorescent detection and photodynamic treatment of tumors by using a fluorescence endoscope or a fluorescent laparoscope. However, the indocyanine green (ICG) has a disadvantage in that the ICG is eliminated from a human body in a relatively short period of time. For instance, the ICG has been eliminated from a human body in about 3 hours. Therefore, the ICG is not suitable for a fluorescent probe for implementing fluorescent detection and photodynamic treatment of tumors. According to the present invention, the macromolecular fluorescent molecular probe has a long half-life time, and thus, the macromolecular fluorescent molecular probe is suitable for a fluorescent probe for implementing fluorescent detection and photodynamic treatment of tumors. The fluorescent molecule in the present invention is not particularly limited, and any fluorescent molecule may be used. For instance, chlorophyll, indocyanine green (ICG), fluorescein, rhodamine, and the like may be used. The fluorescent molecule is preferably water-soluble. The biocompatible macromolecule is not particularly limited, and any biocompatible macromolecule may be used. For instance, a styrene-maleic acid copolymer, a styrene-maleic acid copolymer, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like may be used. The fluorescent molecule and the biocompatible macromolecule may be a complex. The chlorophyll may be chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, or the like. The fluorescent molecule may be chlorophyll a. The biocompatible macromolecule may be a styrene-maleic acid copolymer, a styrene-maleic acid copolymer, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, or the like. The styrene-maleic acid copolymer may be a styrene-maleic acid copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 5000 to 100,000.
