ADAMS, OF READING, PENNSYLVANIA, ASSIGNOR TO THE READING HARDWARE COMPANY, OF SAME PLACE.  \\n ADOOR-HOLDER.  \\n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 618,818, dated February 7, 1899.  \\n Application filed May 31, 1898. Serial No. 682,179 (No model.)  \\n T @ZZ whom t may concern.-  \\n  Be it known that I, WILLIAM T. ADAMS, a citizen of the United States of America, and a resident of Reading, county of Berks, State of Pennsylvania, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Door-Holders, of which the following is a specification.  \\n  My invention relates to devices for holding doors open in any desired position; and it xo consists in certain novel features which are fully described in connection with the accompanying drawings and are particularly set out in the claims.  \\n Figure l is a sectional elevation of the de- &#39;r 5 vice as applied to a door, the bolt being shown in its normal raised position. Fig. 2 is a side elevation showing the bolt lowered to engage the floor, and thereby hold the door. Fig. 3 is a rear elevation of the same, and Fig. 4 is zo a cross-section on the line oo of Fig. l.  \\n  O represents the casing, in which the pushbolt D E is mounted. It is intended to be fastened to the face A of a door in such a manner as to bring the bottom of the bolt,  \\n  when the latter is in its normal raised position, about level with the bottom edge d of the door, so as to ordinarily safely clear the iioor B.  \\n The bolt, as shown, is composed of an up- 3&#39;0 per part D and a lower part E, the latter being preferably of tubular form, having at the lower end a cushion-tip e and mounted upon a stem d2 of the upper part D, to `which it is attached by means of a pin e and upon which. 3 5 it is capable of a limited movement against a spring G, the tension of which normally maintains it in extended or projected position upon the stem e. The main part D of the bolt is suitably guided in the casing, and in 4o connection with the relatively-movable lower part E is normally raised to the position indicated in Fig. l by means of a spring F, a shoulder d of the bolt being in this position in contact with a stop c2 on the interior of the The top d4 of the bolt is suitably shaped to receive pressure from the foot of the operator.  \\n In order to hold the bolt in the lowered position, to which it is necessary to move it in 5o order to press the tip e against the floor and thereby hold the door, I provide a locking mechanism, which consists, as shown, of a trigger I-I, having detents h, which are normally pressed into engagement with toothed edges CZ on the body portion D of the bolt. As shown, these parallel toothed edges d d are separated, so as to allow the trigger to be located between them, the detents h being extended laterally to engage them. This trigger is pivotally mounted on a lug c, provided on the interior of the casing, and it is merely concaved to form a bearing on the lug instead of being pinned thereto, thereby avoiding any drilling or nishing whatever. To avoid its becoming disengaged from the lug e when the parts have been put together and to take the upward strain of the bolt, stop-lugs c are also provided in the casing at a sufficient distance from the lug c to just permit the trigger to swing freely upon the latter without allowing it longitudinal movement. A spring J normally presses it into engagement with the toothed edges d of the bolt, and it projects through the casing at c3 sufficiently to be readily operated by the foot for the pu-rpose of throwing -it out of engagement therewith to release the bolt.  \\n The device having been properly fastened to the door, the latter may be firmly held .by contact with the floor, after which any further downward movement of the main bolt merely serves to compress the spring G more or less, thereby moderately increasing the pressure and providing for the taking vup of any lost motion such as arises from the spacing of the ratchet-teeth on the bolt. The teeth automatically catch upon the detents h of the trigger as the bolt is pressed down, thus locking the latter until the trigger is released, when the retracting-spring automat- IOO ically raises the Whole bolt, thus leaving the door free to be moved as desired.  \\n  I am aware that door-holders of this class have been heretofore devised, and therefore desire to limit my invention to substantially the constructionspecied in the claims.  \\n What I claim isl. In a door-holder the combination with the casing of a push-bolt guided therein and formed with parallel toothed edges CZ d and an intermediate recess or slot, a trigger mounted within said casing upon a fixed support located between said toothed edges of the movable bolt and having lateral detents adapted to engage said toothed edges, and a spring and stop for said trigger substantially as set forth.  \\n  2. In a door-holder the combination with the casing of a push-bolt guided therein and formed with parallel toothed edges d d and an intermediate recess or slot, a trigger mounted within said casing between said toothed edges of the bolt and having lateral detents adapted to engage the same, and a retracting-spring for said bolt located in said recess or slot, substantially as set forth.  \\n  3. In a door-holder the combination with the casing of a two-part push-bolt comprising a longitudinally-slotted upper part having a depending stern d2 and a relatively-movable lower part carried by said stem, a spring mounted upon said stem to normally spread said parts, a trigger or stop for the bolt and a retracting-spring located in said longitudinal slot of the upper part, substantially as set forth.  \\n  4. The combination with the casing and the bolt therein, of a trigger engaging said bolt to lock the same against retraction, said trigger being mounted between pivotal and stop lugs on the casing substantially as described.  \\n  Signed by me at Reading, Pennsylvania, this 28th day of May, 1898.  \\n WILLIAM rr.
